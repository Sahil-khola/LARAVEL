What is Prefix Routing?
Prefix routing is a way to group routes together and give them a common prefix. This is often used for organization purposes.

Route::prefix("student")->group(function () {
    Route::view("/home", "home");
    Route::get("/show", [HomeController::class, "show"]);
    Route::get("/save", [HomeController::class, "Save"]);
});
